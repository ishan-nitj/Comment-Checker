A tool for the problem setting team to identify whether some user is trying to share code in the discussion forum of an on going contest or discuss the solution.

The code is easy to identify if placed in a code snippet within triple backticks.
But not all users place their code within code snippet, which makes the process a little harder.

#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i>A Probabilistic Model

This is a probabilistic model which works by identifying the keywords, operators and other symbols in a comment and then assigns a probability that a comment contains a code from a particular language. Currently, this model supports three languages:C++,Python and Java.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i>Not all comments which contain keywords are codes

> is this True 

Although all three words in this comment are keywords in Python, this comment is not a code.So we cannot discretely specify whether a comment will be a  code.
