what is test case
What are we supposed to do in that case?
I do not understand why
ANyone getting testcase#3 as timeout
can u elaborate with bit of explaination with some exceptional test cases?
can you provide test-cases
can the answer be 
why am i getting 
what is test case about
do we need to handle
what sould be the output for above input
code is running fine in my machine
Can we get the test cases
What is the expected output if
should we consider
How to check
i am unable figure it out
my code is not working 
I just want to know if
can you share your code
please give hint
consider the case when
any idea how to solve it
we have to return
Any suggestions
am I missing something
help
Hint
I realized
would always be
posting the solution
thanks
should print
i suggest you
There can be
think of a situation
you have to calculate 
my point
no need to
for example
for input
Thanks in advance
got correct answer when
my output is
Have you discovered something
affect the answer
iterations
since it gives value
was almost doing the same thing
for which test-case
for which testcase
for which case
what you can do is
dont know where i am going wrong
is it fine to
am i doing right
what is used
algo
algorithm
how can it be wrong
am i doing right
O(n)
O(logn)
O(nlogn)
complexity
O(n^2)
O
